# Mac-address-spoofing
A simple bash script that changes your mac address temporarily! The mac address is reset to the original one as soon as you restart your system.

## Potential use
1. Surfing web anonymously
2. Having no data limit when using publicly available wifi with a limit 
  > (certainly not how I use it)

## Direction of use
1. Change directory to that of the bash script
2. Run the script with the wifi_interface  as the first argument. - [how to find my active wifi-interface?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/405508/how-to-find-name-of-currently-active-network-interface)
```
bash mac_address_scoofer.sh YOUR_WIFI_INTERFACE (e.g: e0)
```

Good Luck!
